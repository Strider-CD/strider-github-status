## Strider Github Status

This gives you nice notifications on pull-requests that are tested, letting you know if the tests would pass or fail on the merged code.

### Requirements

This plugin depends on the latest changes to `strider-github`, so you need to install that straight from git, not npm, in your strider instance.
